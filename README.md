Hi there!

The preference-learning framework makes it easy to learn human decision behavior, yet scales to support complex multiple criteria decision making.

Let's get started right now!

## MATLAB 1.1
The `MATLAB` folder includes the `consistency test` matlab script, which used to detect a set of compatible value function. 
The necessary and possible relation is to find all pairwise preference relations. The return value `f` reveal the preference relation in each between the 1:26 alternatives. This learning process is based on the linear programming and each script need 26*26 times resoves.

## R project 1.1
The `R project` reserve the graphs code for Figure 2 based on the `R rogramming language`, as well as its data. The `fig2` can be used to depict the heatmaps based the three data sets in the data folder.
